# Skin Disease Detection App

## Problem Statement
Skin diseases are a common issue among all age groups. Lack of awareness may cause huge damage to the physical and mental state of the patient. 

There is a very high miss-match between the skin patient and the doctors required to manage them. 

So, It is important to detect skin conditions and get them cured.

 People from rural areas or busy people from urban areas can use an app to detect their skin condition with the help of Artificial Intelligence. 
This gives them a portable and effective detection method at their place. This solution also helps people to prevent getting infected with problems like skin cancer.

## Conclusion
- The Application is being made by **Pankaj Singh Kanyal, Karuna,Jatin,Manas** under the supervision of **Dr Amit Garg and Miss Leeza Sharma**
- The proposed system is able to detect the skin disease with promising results
combining computer vision and machine learning techniques. It can be used to help
people from all over the world and can be used in doing some productive work. The
tools used are free to use and are available for the user, hence, the system can be
deployed free of cost. The application developed is moderately-weight and can be
used in machines with descent system specifications. It has also a simple user
interface for the convenience of the user. The image processing and machine learningalgorithms weresuccessfully implemented.
